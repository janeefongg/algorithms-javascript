##Quadratic Sorting Algorithm Comparison Notes##

**Bubble Sort:**

* The most inefficient sorting algorithm
* Usually taught as a basic sort because it is easy to understand


**Insertion Sort:**

* Versatile
	* Can be used in combination with other sorting algorithms to make it more efficient
* Relatively good for small lists
* Relatively good for partially sorted lists
	* The number of steps in shifting spots and creating the spots are reduced
	* For nearly sorted lists, the time complexity is almost linear

**Selection Sort:**

* More efficient than bubble sort
* Running time is independent of ordering elements
	* This is because we have to go through the same number of steps to search for the smallest element
	* Same number of steps for the exchange
	* Same number of steps for searching the minimum
